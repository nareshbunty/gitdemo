MAVEN
=======
=>In project developement, execution and deployment there will be multiple
complicated ,repetative operations. These operations are called build operations
=>Keep our project ready for execution /release is called building project. Doing
various activities of build process manually is complex and error prone process.

=> To overcome this problem take the support of bat file and automat the process
=> The liimiations with .bat  file we can not write conditional statements to
perform build activities
=>To overcome this problem we can go for ant build tool where we can
automat build activities in condtional env.. by using build.xml file declaratevely.
=> Ant  is just build Tool but it can not be used for project management activities
like dowloading jar files , maintaining repositories, providing standard directory
structures and etc..
=>To these problems of ANT we can use Maven tool which is not only
build tool and it is also a Project management tool.
